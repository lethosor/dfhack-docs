First, don't panic :)

Second, dfhack keeps a few log files in DF's folder (`stderr.log` and
`stdout.log`). Looking at these might help you solve the problem.
If it doesn't, you can ask for help in the forum thread or on IRC.

If you found a bug, you can report it in the Bay12 DFHack thread, the issues
tracker on Github, or visit the #dfhack IRC channel on freenode.
