{"name":"Dfhack-docs","tagline":"","body":"# DFHack\r\n\r\nDFHack is a Dwarf Fortress memory access library, distributed with scripts and plugins implementing a wide variety of useful functions and tools.\r\n\r\nFor users, it provides a significant suite of bugfixes and interface enhancements by default, and more can be enabled. There are also many tools (such as `workflow` or `autodump`) which can make life easier. You can even add third-party scripts and plugins to do almost anything!\r\n\r\nFor modders, DFHack makes many things possible. Custom reactions, new interactions, magic creature abilities, and more can be set through scripts and custom raws. Non-standard DFHack scripts and inits can be stored in the raw directory, making raws or saves fully self-contained for distribution - or for coexistence in a single DF install, even with incompatible components.\r\n\r\nFor developers, DFHack unites the various ways tools access DF memory and allows easier development of new tools. As an open-source project under various copyleft licences, contributions are welcome.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
