## Compatibility

DFHack is available for Windows (XP or later), Linux (any modern distribution), or OS X (10.6.8 and up).

Most releases only support the version of DF mentioned in their title - for example, DFHack 0.40.24-r2 only supports DF 0.40.24 - but some releases support earlier DF versions as well. Wherever possible, use the latest version built for the target version of DF.

On Windows, DFHack is compatible with the SDL version of DF, but not the legacy version.

It is also possible to use the Windows DFHack with Wine under Linux and OS X.

## Installation/Removal

Installing DFHack involves copying files into your DF folder. Copy the files from a release archive so that:

* On Windows, SDL.dll is replaced
* On Linux and OS X, the 'dfhack' script is placed in the same folder as the 'df' script
  * The stonesense plugin might require some additional libraries on Linux.

Uninstalling is basically the same, in reverse:

* On Windows, first delete SDL.dll and rename SDLreal.dll to SDL.dll. Then remove the other DFHack files
* On Linux and OS X, Remove the DFHack files.

If any of the plugins or DFHack itself refuses to load, check the stderr.log file created in your DF folder.

## Getting started

If DFHack is installed correctly, it will automatically pop up a console window once DF is started as usual on windows. Linux and Mac OS X require running the dfhack script from the terminal, and will use that terminal for the console.

**NOTE:**
The `dfhack-run` executable is used for calling DFHack commands in an already-running
DF+DFHack instance from external OS scripts and programs, and is not the way how you use DFHack normally.

DFHack has a lot of features, which can be accessed by typing commands in the console, or by mapping them to keyboard shortcuts. Most of the newer and more user-friendly tools are designed to be at least partially used via the latter way.

In order to set keybindings, you have to create a text configuration file called ``dfhack.init``; the installation comes with an example version called ``dfhack.init-example``, which is fully functional, covers all of the recent features and can be simply renamed to ``dfhack.init``. You are encouraged to look through it to learn which features it makes available under which key combinations.
